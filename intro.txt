The United Nations are currently negotiating a new legally binding agreement for the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ).
The BBNJ process began with Ad-Hoc Informal Working Group and Preparatory Committee Meetings (2005-2018) and then formally started with the Intergovernmental Conferences (IGCs). 
<a href="https://undocs.org/en/a/res/72/249">Resolution 72/249</a> sets out four IGC meetings, the last one of which was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 During this intersessional period until the planned-to-be-final conference will take place, negotiations continue informally through online exchanges, 
such as online dialogues, organized by Belgium, Costa Rica, Monaco and NGOs (High Seas Treaty Dialogues), as well as an intersessional work platform organized by the BBNJ Secretariat,
Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea (UNDOALOS).

This database compiles scientific, peer-reviewed literature on the BBNJ process in English language.
It is a comprehensive overview of all BBNJ literature from its beginnings (in 2004) until early 2021 and is continuously updated by the MARIPOLDATA team. 
Users of the database can easily navigate through a large amount of publications by filtering for specific package elements of the agreement, keywords and years of publications. 
Abstracts to all publications (where available) are provided to give a brief overview, as well as immediate access through a link that leads to the official publication website. Statistics are provided to show distributions of publications by topic, year, region and source. 
This database provides a structured, facilitated access to existing scientific publications and therefore serves to inform BBNJ decision-makers, practitioners and incentivizes further 
academic debates within the BBNJ scientific community.
